ðŸŽ¬ IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with Simple RNN

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset using a Simple RNN (ReLU activation) model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
It also includes a Streamlit web app where users can enter a review and get a positive/negative classification.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Step 1: Text preprocessing using one-hot encoding and padding.

Step 2: Model building with an embedding layer and a Simple RNN for sequence learning.

Step 3: Training on the IMDB dataset with early stopping.

Step 4: Saving the trained model for later use.

Step 5: Streamlit interface for interactive review classification.
